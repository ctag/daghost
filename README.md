Ghosting extension for DeviantArt


## What is this

DA Ghost isn't my tool. It's an existing Firefox addon which allows DeviantArt users to block the thumbnails of undesired persons or collections.

[The original](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/da-ghost/?src=search) doesn't work with current Firefox versions, and appears to be unmaintained. The addon site is a mess without a tool to adopt broken addons, so I have to rehost it.
